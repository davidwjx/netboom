/****f* i2c.functions/dw_i2c_setListener
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  This function is used to set a user listener function.  The listener

 *  error interrupts, general calls, read requests, and receive full
 *  when no receive buffer is available.  There is no need to clear any
 *  interrupts in the listener as this is handled automatically by the
 *  Driver Kit interrupt handlers.
 *
 *  A listener must be setup up before using any of the other functions
 *  of the Interrupt API.  Note that if the dw_i2c_userIrqHandler
 *  interrupt handler is being used, none of the other Interrupt API
 *  functions can be used with it.  This is because they are symbiotic
 *  with the dw_i2c_irqHandler() interrupt handler.
 * ARGUMENTS
 *  dev         -- DW_apb_i2c device handle
 *  listener    -- function pointer to user listener function
 * RETURN VALUE
 *  none
 * NOTES
 *  This function enables the following interrupts: I2c_irq_rx_under,
 *  I2c_irq_rx_over, I2c_irq_tx_over, I2c_irq_rd_req, I2c_irq_tx_abrt,
 *  I2c_irq_rx_done, and I2c_irq_gen_call.  It also enables
 *  I2c_irq_rx_full is the DmaRxMode is not set to hardware handshaking.
 *  The dw_callback function pointer typedef is defined in the common
 *  header files.
 *
 *  Whether the dw_i2c_userIrqHandler() or dw_i2c_irqHandler() interrupt
 *  handler is being used, this function is used to set the user
 *  listener function that is called by both of them.
 * EXAMPLE
 *  In the case of new data being received, the irq handler
 *  (dw_i2c_irqHandler) would call the user listener function as
 *  follows:
 *
 *  userListener(dev, I2c_irq_rx_full);
 *
 *  It is the listener function's responsibility to properly handle
 *  this. For example:
 *
 *  dw_i2c_slaveReceive(dev, buffer, length, callback);

/****f* i2c.functions/dw_i2c_slaveReceive
 * DESCRIPTION
 *  This function initiates an interrupt-driven slave receive transfer.
 *  To do this, the I2C must first be properly configured and enabled.
 *  This function sets up and enables the receive interrupt to fill the
 *  buffer from the receive FIFO.  Upon completion, the callback
 *  function is called (if it is not NULL).
 *
 *  A transfer may be stopped at any time by calling dw_i2c_terminate(),
 *  which returns the number of bytes that were received before the
 *  transfer was interrupted.  A terminated transfer's callback function
 *  is never called.
 * ARGUMENTS

 *  This function is part of the Interrupt API and should not be called
 *  when using the I2C in a poll-driven manner.
 * WARNINGS
 *  The user listener function is run in interrupt context and, as such,
 *  care must be taken to ensure that any data shared between it and
 *  normal code is adequately protected from corruption.  Depending on
 *  the target platform, spinlocks, mutexes or semaphores may be used to
 *  achieve this.
